# Notion iOS Reverse Engineering

This project documents the structure, UI patterns, user flows, and implementation complexity of the **Notion iOS mobile app**, as part of a design system recovery and AI-first development blueprint.

## 📌 Project Goal
Analyze and reverse-engineer the Notion iOS app to produce documentation that could enable an AI developer to replicate its features. This includes screens, flows, component architecture, effort estimates, and prompt engineering examples.

## 🤖 Example AI Prompt (From `ai-prompts.md`)
```markdown
**Feature:** Page Editor (Text Blocks)
**Tech:** Flutter + Firebase

"Build a Flutter UI for editing a list of text blocks. Each block is a TextField. When the user hits 'Enter', create a new block. Add a toolbar above the keyboard to style text (bold, italics, to-do). Save blocks to Firestore in page_id order."
```
